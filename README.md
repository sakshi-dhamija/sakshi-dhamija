<h3 align="center">Backend Engineer @ <a href="https://www.wayground.in">Wayground</a> | ex-<a href="https://groww.in">Groww</a></h3>

<p align="center">
I enjoy building <b> backend systems</b> and love the process of making them better with every iteration.  
Currently working in the <b>tech-ed</b> space (previously in <b>fintech</b>), experimenting with ideas that stick.

### 🧠 Currently Exploring
- Learning **Golang** and sharpening **problem-solving** skills  
- Diving into **AI tools** — I love how they simplify workflows, leave space for creativity, and make learning faster  
- Building things faster, cleaner, and smarter — one iteration at a time  
- Creating content and sharing what I learn along the way

### 💭 A Bit More About Me
- I enjoy learning by doing — from new backend frameworks to system design experiments  
- I like figuring out how things work (and sometimes, how to make them break 😄)  
- I love talking about random things — tech, life, ideas —  
  feel free to say hi anytime, I’ll definitely leave you with something interesting ✨
